"""app.rules.plateau_detector

Plateau detection is evaluated over a 7-day calendar window.

Rule A (trend change):
- Compare average weight of the last 7-day window vs the previous 7-day window.
- Plateau condition: abs(avg_change) < 0.2 kg.

Rule B (fluctuation band):
- Within the last 7-day window, weight stays within ±0.3 kg.
- Plateau condition: (max - min) <= 0.6 kg.

Minimum data requirement:
- At least 5 recorded days within the last 7-day window.

Notes:
- The caller may optionally provide an explicit anchor_date (e.g. "today") to
  make the time window user-meaningful. If omitted, the latest record date is
  used as the anchor.
